#Approach: In the code you provided, you are reversing the list s using the slice notation s[::-1]. Then, you are assigning the reversed list back to s[:]. The [:] slice notation is used to modify the original list in place. Finally, you print the reversed list.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation:

# s[::-1]: This creates a reversed version of the list s. The [::-1] slice notation means to start from the end and move backward with a step of -1.

# s[:] = s[::-1]: This assigns the reversed list back to the original list s. This modifies the content of the original list in place.

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        s[:] = s[::-1]
        return s
